  abstract = {Accurately modeling and predicting the mean and volatility of electricity prices can be of great importance to value electricity, bid or hedge against the volatility of electricity prices and manage risk. The paper applies various autoregressive moving average (ARMA) models with generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) processes, namely ARMA–GARCH models, along with their modified forms, ARMA–GARCH-in-mean (ARMA–GARCH-M), to model and forecast hourly ahead electricity prices. In total, 10 different model structures are adopted, and this paper thus conducts a comprehensive investigation on the ARMA–GARCH based time series forecasting of electricity prices. Multiple statistical measures are employed to evaluate the modeling sufficiency and predication accuracy of the ARMA–GARCH(-M) methods. The results show that the ARMA–GARCH-M models are in general an effective tool for modeling and forecasting the mean and volatility of electricity prices, while ARMA–SGARCH-M models are simple and robust and the ARMA–GJRGARCH-M model is very competitive. In addition, we observe that hourly electricity prices exhibit apparent daily, weekly and monthly periodicities, and have the nonlinear and asymmetric time-varying volatility together with an inverse leverage effect.},

  abstract={ This paper considers the valuation of a spread call when asset prices are log-normal. The implicit strategy of the Kirk formula is to exercise if the price of the long asset exceeds a given power function of the price of the short asset. We derive a formula for the spread call value, conditional on following this feasible, but non-optimal, exercise strategy. Numerical investigations indicate that the lower bound produced by our formula is extremely accurate. The precision is much greater than the Kirk formula. Moreover, optimizing with respect to the strategy parameters (which corresponds to the Carmona-Durrleman procedure) yields only a marginal improvement of accuracy (if any).},

abstract = "We examine investments in power generation projects under policy uncertainty, when the investor has the choice between two alternative technologies, a gas-fired plant and a wind plant. Increased likelihood of subsidy withdrawal reduces the payoff from and postpones investments in the wind technology. Simultaneously, it accelerates investments in gas, thereby eliminating or further postponing investments in wind capacity. We show that this substitution phenomenon can be of first order importance: it can have a significant impact on the timing of investment, the wind premium, and the probability of investing in the wind technology. Our results provide new insights about the scope and impact of green energy regulation.",

In Operations Research (OR), a field that encompasses a plethora of problem-solving techniques for improving decision-making, we note an observable steady increase in contributions that apply the Real Options approach to model, analyze and evaluate flexible operating alternatives available to decision-makers or to optimize the operational efficiency of decision timing. We review 164 papers that appeared in five internationally-renowned OR journals in the last twelve years, cataloguing the main subject themes and contributions where the Real Options approach has been most valuable to Operations Research. We classify the reviewed papers into six main subject themes, and identify their main characteristics, the modeling approaches used, key issues and sub-categories. We further document current trends and suggest promising opportunities for future research.}

  abstract = {Cryptocurrency is a relatively new combination of cryptology and currency in financial areas and is increasingly frequently used worldwide. Blockchain applications are expected to reshape the renewable energy market. However, there is a lack of studies covering the power usage of digital currencies. Therefore, this study ran experiments on mining efficiency of nine kinds of cryptocurrencies and ten algorithms. A comparison of statistical analysis of data in a benchmark and experiment results of Monero mining was conducted. Thereafter, this study provided an estimation of global electricity consumption of the Monero mining activity. The results indicated that the hashing algorithm mainly determines the mining efficiency. Data analysis and experiments and estimated Monero mining electricity consumption in the world and its carbon emission in China as a case study. In 2018, Monero mining may consume 645.62 GWh of electricity in the world after its hard fork. The Monero mining in China may consume 30.34 GWh and contribute a carbon emission of 19.12–19.42 thousand tons from April to December in 2018. Although cryptocurrency mining and blockchain technology are promising, their influence on energy conversation and sustainable development should be further studied.},

@book{glasserman2004monte,
  abstract = {"This book develops the use of Monte Carlo methods in finance, and it also uses simulation as a vehicle for presenting models and ideas from financial engineering. It divides roughly into three parts. The first part develops the fundamentals of Monte Carlo methods, the foundations of derivatives pricing, and the implementation of several of the most important models used in financial engineering. The next part describes techniques for improving simulation accuracy and efficiency. The final third of the book addresses special topics: estimating price sensitivities, valuing American options, and measuring market risk and credit risk in financial portfolios." "The most important prerequisite is familiarity with the mathematical tools used to specify and analyze continuous time models in finance, in particular the key ideas of stochastic calculus. Prior exposure to the basic principles of option pricing is useful but not essential." "The book is aimed at graduate students in financial engineering, researchers in Monte Carlo simulation, and practitioners implementing models in industry."--Jacket.},
